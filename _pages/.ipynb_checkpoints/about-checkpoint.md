This site is RecoHut's official notebook portal, contains interactive jupyter notebooks on recommender systems.

## Goals
Our goal is to:
1. Collect community ideas and approaches related to recommender systems
2. Test out these ideas in [ML environments](https://www.notion.so/FAQs-75baec6bce2d4b669688fe8b88ebd7f0)
3. Convert these tested ideas into reusable Jupyter notebooks
4. Create a centralized public database for these notebooks

## How it works?

1. List down a batch of ideas and approaches, searching web on a daily and weekly basis
2. Select the best ones
3. Divide them into 3 categories - Theory, Practical, and Theory+Practical
    1. Theory batch - Document in recodocs
    2. Practical batch - Document in [reconb-dev](https://nb-dev.recohut.com/)
    3. Theory+Practical batch - Document theory part in recodocs, also add theory in notebook markdowns, and document the notebook in [reconb-dev](https://nb-dev.recohut.com/)
4. After design and relevancy validation, move the weekly/bi-weekly batch from [reconb-dev](https://nb-dev.recohut.com/) to [reconb](https://nb.recohut.com/)

## How to use it?

1. As a search engine - to find quick solutions to the problems at hand
2. As a learning resource
